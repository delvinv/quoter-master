# quoter-master
Web application that will generate a wall of quotes. Initially being designed with Metro-UI design theme in mind. I will be incorporating more patterns in the future.

## Technologies
- Using HTML5, CSS3, JS and jQuery libraries

## TODO
- Importing quotes and authors (csv, txt files)
- Treemap wall of squares
- Responsive canvas that responds to number of quotes
- Interface to configure changes.
